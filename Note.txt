 Attention 1:

 Each high dimensional gaussian distribution has zero cov, which mean
 the high dimensional normal distribution could be decomposed as
 the product of multiple single dimensional normal distribution.

Attention 2:

When calculate the negative_elbo_bound, rec loss is generated by one single z, instead of expectation,
which I think maybe be a problem.

Attention 3:

When implementing the GMVAE and IWAE, there are log of mean of the multiple normal distributions.
Instead of get this, the code I think shows us how to get the sum of log of normal distributions minus log K.
Which mean cause trouble.
log(1/K * sum(normal_dist)) -> -log(K) + sum(log(single normal_dist))
